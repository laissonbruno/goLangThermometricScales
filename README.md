# Temperature Converter

This is a simple Go program that converts temperature from Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C). It includes constants for the boiling and melting points of water in Fahrenheit.

## Installation

Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can install it from [here](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/laissonbruno/goLangThermometricScales.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd temp-converter
    ```

3. Run the program:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

## Output

The program will display the boiling point of water in Fahrenheit and Celsius, as well as the melting point of water in both Fahrenheit and Celsius.

For example:

The boiling point of water in °F = 212 (int), boiling point of water in °C = 100 (int).
The melting point of water in °F = 32 (int), and the melting point of water in °C = 0 (int).
